#Cellular Image Classification

Recursion Pharmaceuticals presented a competition on Kaggle to differentiate biological signal from experimental noise in cellular images.
Images of cells from multiple cell lines after one of 1,108 different genetic perturbations were provided and split into training and testing datasets. 
Machine learning models should be used to classify images of cells with a specific genetic perturbation label.
